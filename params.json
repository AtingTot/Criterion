What's wrong with other test frameworks?**  \r\nA. I worked with CUnit and Check, and I must say that they do their job\r\n   very well -- the only thing that bugs me is that setting up a test\r\n   suite from scratch is a pain, it should really be simpler. Most\r\n   (if not all) high-level languages have test frameworks with automatic\r\n   test registration, but all the ones for C require you to set up a\r\n   main, manually register suites, then tests. Criterion tries to\r\n   fix these shortcomings.\r\n\r\n**Q. Where has this been tested?**  \r\nA. Currently, on Linux 2.6.32 and Linux 3.15.7, although it should work on\r\n   most \\*nix systems; Mac OS X Yosemite 10.10, FreeBSD 10.0, and finally\r\n   Windows 7 (with the MinGW and Cygwin ports of GCC).\r\n\r\n[online-docs]: http://criterion.readthedocs.org/\r\n[pdf-docs]: http://readthedocs.org/projects/criterion/downloads/pdf/latest/\r\n[zip-docs]: http://readthedocs.org/projects/criterion/downloads/htmlzip/latest/\r\n[epub-docs]: http://readthedocs.org/projects/criterion/downloads/epub/latest/\r\n\r\n[samples]: https://github.com/Snaipe/Criterion/tree/bleeding/samples/\r\n[sample-simple]: https://github.com/Snaipe/Criterion/blob/bleeding/samples/simple.c\r\n[sample-suites]: https://github.com/Snaipe/Criterion/blob/bleeding/samples/suites.c\r\n[sample-asserts]: https://github.com/Snaipe/Criterion/blob/bleeding/samples/asserts.c\r\n[sample-fixtures]: https://github.com/Snaipe/Criterion/blob/bleeding/samples/fixtures.c\r\n[sample-signal]: https://github.com/Snaipe/Criterion/blob/bleeding/samples/signal.c\r\n[sample-report]: https://github.com/Snaipe/Criterion/blob/bleeding/samples/report.c\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
